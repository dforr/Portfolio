      <h2>History:</h2>
      <br>
      <p>In 1925, the Zeeb family built a working farm in Ann Arbor. Their property and buildings were purchased by Tom Monaghan (founder of Domino's Pizza) in the early 1980's to create space for his large office complex. To honor the history of the farm, Monaghan built the petting farm for families to come visit.</p>
      <br>
      <p>In 1989, as construction of the office complex progressed, the Zeeb barn was moved across the road to its current location. Twenty acres were allocated for the site and the Zeeb barn became a shelter for animals once more. </p>
      <br>
      <p>In 1996 The Petting Farm became a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization. The farm stands as a symbol of appreciation and commitment to the agriculture industry and the traditional farm values that are evident in our culture.</p>
