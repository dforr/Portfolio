      <h2>About the Farm:</h2>
      <br>
      <p>The Petting Farm at Domino's Farms is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization. Therefore, the farm relys on the support of its customers and sponsors as well as donations to keep our facility open to the public.</p>
      <br>
      <p>The farm is home to a large range of animals which include: Cats, Cattle, Chickens, Ducks, Equine, Goats, Llamas, Peacocks, Pigs, Rabbits, Sheep, Alpacas and more! Many of the animals here are rescued and will stay at the farm for the rest of their lives. Some animals are even born and spend their whole life at the farm aswell!</p>
      <br>
      <p>Guests to the farm are able to encouraged to explore the grounds and interact with all the animals there.  Purchasing bags of feed allows guests to be a part of the feeding process for the animals.  Getting a tractor ride ticket is also a great opportunity to see parts of the farm that you cannot reach by foot.   </p>
